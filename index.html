            <p class="text-small"> Futures are derivative financial contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The buyer must purchase or the seller must sell the underlying asset at the set price, regardless of the current market price at the expiration date.   </p>

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">What Are Futures Contracts?</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Futures contracts are an investment vehicle that allows the buyer to bet on the future price of a commodity or other security. There are many types of futures contracts available. These may have underlying assets such as oil, stock market indices, currencies, and agricultural products.
       Unlike forward contracts, which are customized between the parties involved, futures contracts trade on organized exchanges such as those operated by the CME Group Inc. (CME). Futures contracts are popular among traders, who aim to profit on price swings, as well as commercial customers who wish to hedge their risks. </p>

         <p class="sectionTag text-big">Are Futures a Type of Derivative?</p>
         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">They are derivatives because their value is based on the value of an underlying asset, such as oil in the case of crude oil futures.Like many derivatives, futures are a leveraged financial instrument, offering the potential for outsized gains or losses. As such, they are generally considered to be an advanced trading instrument and are usually traded only by experienced investors and institutions.Oftentimes, traders who hold futures contracts until expiration will settle their position in cash. In other words, the trader will simply pay or receive a cash settlement depending on whether the underlying asset increased or decreased during the investment holding period.
         In some cases, however, futures contracts will require physical delivery. In this scenario, the investor holding the contract upon expiration would take delivery of the underlying asset. They'd be responsible for the goods and covering costs for material handling, physical storage, and insurance. </p>
